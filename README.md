# ⛑️ IPs to block over your webservers
## A list of known IPs that everyone should block on their webservers (static IP scanners)

This is a list of scanners that do nothing but check traffic and scan servers. They're not scrapers, spiders or crawlers, they do this with webservers as well as other services.
**_Under the pretext of analyzing the network they perform checks and take information._**
There's nobody who prohibits this practice so everyone is pretending to be God and controlling other people's servers/organizations by scanning files (sometimes even looking for file names that should be private). Anyone could open a service like this and scan other people's servers claiming to perform security checks.

After careful analysis of the logs, these are the known static IPs sorted that annoy webmasters and server system administrators.

The list will be updated as soon as possible in the same way it's modified on managed servers.
<!-- This list should be called fuck these bastards -->
N.B. 0/24 is a [CIRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation to identify a group of IPs. When you see it at the end it means all the IPs from 0 to 255. If you are a server administrator you most likely already know this.

Feel free to do so or not.

For Apache HTTP Server you can use `.htaccess` or `apache.conf` and [set these IPs as forbidden](https://serverfault.com/questions/714270/how-to-block-ip-in-htaccess-on-apache-2-4#answer-750459).

In case you have more services use a firewall (eg [ufw](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu) for Linux, [Windows Firewall](https://knowledge.civilgeo.com/configuring-windows-firewall-to-allow-or-block-ip-addresses/) for Windows).
